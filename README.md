# BFSI-Credit-Risk-Assignment

**For this assignment, we will focus on the expected credit loss (ECL) calculation method.**
Expected credit loss (ECL) computation is a method used in credit risk management to determine the amount of loss a bank is expected to incur in the event a borrower defaults on their loan. Different banks may use different methodologies for calculating the expected credit loss (ECL) and provisioning. rk of a bank. Banks are allowed to use their own methodologies and incorporate factors relevant to their specific business operations. Some banks may choose to use historical data and statistical models to estimate the components of ECL calculation, while others may rely on expert judgement. The choice of the method can vary depending on factors such as the bank's risk appetite, the nature of the loans and the available data. Additionally, some banks may include certain external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, in their calculations, while others may not.

**The formula for ECL typically used in practice is as follows:**
ECL = EAD x PD x LGD

Expected credit loss = Exposure at default x Probability of Default x Loss given default]

ECLs are calculated based on the exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) for each borrower. Banks can calculate the ECL for different points in time based on their risk management strategy and regulatory requirements.

For this assignment, we will consider the latest date from which the data is available as the point in time. This means we will estimate the expected credit loss (ECL) for the borrower assuming that the borrower has defaulted at the present point in time.
